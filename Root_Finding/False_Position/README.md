# falsePosition
finds the roots using the false postiton method, it slowly cuts the distance between points in half until the error is small enough to stop
## Variables
* func is the function we are checking
* xl is the first x position
* xu is the last x position
* es is the stoppinng criteria, given as percent
* maxit is the max number of iterations before the program stops
## Outputs
* Root is the x positon where the root is
* fx is the funtion at the root
* ea is the error after it has run
* iter is the number of iterations after it has run
