# Sec
is the secant method of finding roots, using a secnt line through two points in order to estimate the root of the function
## variables
* func is the function
* x1 is the first x position
* x2 is the second x position
* es is the stopping criteria in the form of percent error
## Outputs
* root is th ex position of the roots
* iter is the number of iterations the program went through
* ea is the approximate error percent
# modSec
is a modified version of the secant method but only uses 1 x position
## Variables
* func is the function
* x0 is the inital x position
* delta is any integer, the smaller it is the more acurate the answer should be
* i is the max number of iterations
* es is the stopping criteria in the form of percent error
## Outputs
* root is the root of the functions
* iter is the number of iterations
* ea is the aproximate error percent
