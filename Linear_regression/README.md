# LinearRegression
Creates a line of best fit and everything that goes along with it from two matrixes
## Variables
* X is the matrix containing the x positions
* Y is the variable containing the y positions
## Outputs
* fX is the sorted x cooridinates without outliers
* fY is the sorted y coordinates without outliers
* slope is a variable that contains the slope
* Intercept is the y intercept of the new equation
* Rsquared is the relationship between the new equation and the points
