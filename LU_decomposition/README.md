#luFactor uses LU Decomposition to solve for variables in linear algebra
## Variables
A is the coeficient Matrix
## Outputs
* L is the lower triangular Matrix
* U is the upper triangular Matrix
* P is the Pivot Matrix
## Descrition
It pivots the row with the largest nuumber in the first loaction and then changes the pivot Matrix so they are still in the right orientation, then it goes through the proccess of solving for each variable.
